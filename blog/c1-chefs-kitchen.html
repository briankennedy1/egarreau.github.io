      Growing up, my sister and I had a pet hedgehog named Piglet. (Technically she belonged to my sister, but I always took care of her so I'm claiming retroactive joint custody.) On sunny days, I would take her out to my mom's garden to root around in the dirt and eat bugs (she ate bugs. I ate sandwiches). When I went to fetch her from her cage, she always reacted the same way: as soon as I opened the top she would snap into a ball, curling up to protect her soft belly and make her whole body sharp and prickly. I would hold her with my sleeves or the bottom of my shirt to avoid pricking my hands, and then bring her out into the sunshine and sit down on a warm patch of grass. I put her in my lap and carefully ran my fingers along her sharp quills as I read my book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, slowly, after five or ten minutes, her quills began to relax.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, slowly, she began to unfurl from the tight ball.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, a tiny pink nose would appear from underneath all those quills, wiggling around in the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly she was off like a rocket, her tiny legs a blur as she darted all around the garden, digging under rocks, sniffing at leaves, drawing out her startlingly long tongue to  test the gritty dirt and snap up grubs. She would roll around in the grass like a dog, stubby legs waving and soft pink belly exposed to the sun. She would coat her whole body in dirt and grass and leaves until her bright white quills were almost indistinguishable from the garden around her. Every once in a while some noise or movement would startle her and she would snap back into a ball, but usually it would only take a minute until her nose led her back out into the world again.

      Obviously I have told this charming anecdote in order to draw some kind of analogy about how I am feeling about Dev Bootcamp. (Hint: I am the hedgehog.) This first week (and a half, because I am already behind, gulp) has been totally overwhelming, and I can feel myself reacting with sharp quills. When I applied to DBC I was scared, but I was so excited about the possibilities that it was easy to ignore my fears. Now that I'm in it, doing the work every day, cyber-meeting my classmates, and (dear god) <em>tweeting</em> about it all, I'm terrified. It certainly doesn't help that I was sick the entire first week so I'm already limping behind the rest of my cohort. So I feel myself curling into a ball and sticking up my quills. All my required tweets are snide and defensive. My first blog post opened with a long disclaimer. I still haven't emailed the rest of my cohort to introduce myself, and the idea of pair programming makes me want to hide under the covers forever. Meanwhile, the DBC curriculum tells me this is the time when vulnerability is most important. That I must skin my ignorance (as we say in the south) and expose my soft pink belly to the world in the name of LEARNING. And I believe them, I do! This educational philosophy is one of the main reasons I chose DBC over the myriad other programs with similar curricula<a href="#footnote">*</a>. I want to get on board with this program; I want to bring my whole self; I want to tear down all my walls Gorbachev-style, <a href="http://www.teen.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Michael-Cera-But-Its-Hard1.gif">but it's haaaaaaaard</a>. And honestly, I'm surprised that it's hard. Maybe I shouldn't be, since vulnerability is like the #1 scariest thing in our society, but I believed in this so deeply in theory that I never thought I would have a problem putting it into action. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gdfSSo7.gif">Lulz</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this is what makes me both nervous and excited about DBC's culture. (Mostly nervous, right now. Trying to get back to excited.) In order to get the most out of this process -- or really, in order to get *anything* out of this process -- I have to uncurl from my tight, tense ball and really start rolling in the dirt. It's all on me; I can't blame the instructors or the curriculum if I have a bad time. Deep breath, here we go.
